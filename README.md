# Smart Campus System 🚗🏫

## Overview

The **Smart Campus System** is an IoT-based project designed to automate and secure campus entry using smart number plate recognition and motion-based lighting. The system utilizes an embedded ESP-based webpage for uploading vehicle images, which are then processed in the cloud to extract and verify number plates. The result determines whether to grant or deny access, controlling a gate barrier accordingly. Additionally, motion-detected lighting enhances energy efficiency around the entrance area.

## Features

- 📷 **Smart Number Plate Recognition**
  - Vehicle images are uploaded via an ESP-hosted embedded web page.
  - Images are sent to **Azure Blob Storage**.
  - A cloud function processes the image to extract the number plate using machine learning.
  - The extracted number is stored in an **Azure SQL Database** along with a timestamp.
  - Based on recognition:
    - ✅ Positive acknowledgement triggers the **barrier gate to open**.
    - ❌ Negative acknowledgement shows **"Access Denied"** on an LCD display at the gate.

- 💡 **Motion-Activated Lights**
  - **IR sensors** detect motion at the gate area.
  - Lights are activated only when motion is detected, saving energy.
